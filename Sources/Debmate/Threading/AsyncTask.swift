/**
    - requires:
 `import Debmate`

 Run a computation on a non-main thread, delivering results
 back to the main thread, with cancelation.
 
 Each AsyncTask instance allows for a single task to be running
 on a non-main thread.  Explicitly canceling a working task, or
 adding a new task via execute() indicates that the work being
 done by the currently running task is to be discarded.
 
 Accordingly, a canceled task does not run its completion handler,
 but does run its cancelation handlers (if any).
 
 Note that the actual work function being run is never explicitly
 terminated; instead, the work function may, if it chooses, opt
 to short-circuit its work by affecting its state via the cancelation
 handlers.  For example, a cancelation handler might instruct an ongoing
 network connection to shutdown and return earlier.
 
 More directly, a computation can always check for cancelation by
 writing
 
     if AsyncTask.wasCanceled {
        // return early
     }
 
 This will return true only if the request is made from the specific
 non-main queue in which the work was actually launched.  Additionally,
 once started, a running task can add additional cancelation handlers
 (again, only from the non-main queue in which the task was actually
 launched) by writing, for example:
 
     let dataTask = urlSession.dataTask(with: someURL)
     AsyncTask.addCancelationHandler { dataTask.cancel() }
 
 In this case, the cancelation handler could not be added when the work
 was scheduled, but only after work had progressed.  If the AsyncTask.cancel()
 method is called for the above work, this results in the dataTask object
 receiving a cancel request.
